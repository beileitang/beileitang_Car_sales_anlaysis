**#Forecasting monthly car sales by
ARIMA**

During past three years, there
were many super markets like Target, Future shop, and Sear etc. were forced to exit the Canadian market or to shut
down. The reason why company would fail
the market is complex but good business strategy could improve businesses
management. Consequently, management strategies seem to have become an
important issue to businesses. In addition to that, as technology advances,
people use technology to facilitate our lives and increase product yields.
Hence, we think we could use statistics technology to predict sales and to
improve business management. Forecasting is the key component of great business
management for a company, because It can reduce the loss by predicting demand.
Also, Time series is a statistical technique to use historical data to forecast
the future because it believes what happened in the past will happen again in
the future. The primary goal of this project is to forecast the next yearâ€™s
sales by using historical data.
